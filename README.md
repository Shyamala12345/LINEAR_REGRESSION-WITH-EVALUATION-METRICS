# LINEAR_REGRESSION-WITH-EVALUATION-METRICS
Evaluation metrics for a linear regression model
Evaluation metrics are a measure of how good a model performs and how well it approximates the relationship. Like MSE, MAE, R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and RMSE.
Why We require Evaluation Metrics?
Most beginners and practitioners most of the time do not bother about the model performance. The talk is about building a well-generalized model, Machine learning model cannot have 100 per cent efficiency otherwise the model is known as a biased model. which further includes the concept of overfitting and underfitting.
